In this archive you can find documentation of talks, discussions, film screenings, tours, and other events that took place as part of or relating to the Urban Reviewer. In the past, two major presentations of the Urban Reviewer took place at the **Queens Museum (“Reviewing Renewal”)** in early 2015 and as part of **Spontaneous Interventions on Governor’s Island** in summer 2014. 


## Reviewing Renewal

From **January 11 to February 8, 2015**, the Urban Reviewer came to life as an intervention on the Panorama of the City of New York at the **Queens Museum** for **Reviewing Renewal**. We put all 155+ Urban Renewal Area Plans that NYC ever adopted on the Panorama, with accompanying programs every Sunday and wall treatments that invited visitors to see and shape urban renewal in our city. For more information on the exhibition, including a full program of related events, please visit [596 Acres](http://596acres.org/news/2014/12/23/596-acres-presents-the-urban-reviewer-on-the-queens-museum-panorama/). 

For Reviewing Renewal, we also created the first ever printed atlas of Urban Renewal Area Planning 1949-2015. You can download it [here](http://www.urbanreviewer.org/media/QueensMuseum_Broadsheet_ReviewingRenewal.pdf).

A walking tour of the Willets Point Urban Renewal Area with Dr. Jack Eichenbaum, Queens Borough Historian. East of Citifield (the New York Mets baseball stadium) is a sewerless hardscrabble area of auto junkyards and related businesses that has twice beaten back attempts at redevelopment. But as it is located between the new stadium and a booming Chinatown in Flushing, public and private interests are again trying to transform “Willets Point.” _For more information on this event, please visit [596 Acres' website](http://596acres.org/news/2014/12/23/596-acres-presents-the-urban-reviewer-on-the-queens-museum-panorama/)._

**Reviewing Renewal: Adam Purple and the Garden of Eden** 
by Harvey Wang and Amy Brost

In 1975, on the crime-ridden Lower East Side, Adam Purple started a garden behind his tenement home. By 1986, The Garden of Eden was world famous and had grown to 15,000 square feet. For Adam – a social activist, philosopher, artist, and revolutionary – the Garden was the medium of his political and artistic expression. It was razed by the city in 1986 after a protracted court battle. This film documents the creation of this artwork and its ultimate destruction.  Winner of the "Neighborhood Award" at the Lower East Side Film Festival.
