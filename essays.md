**What Was Is Urban Renewal in New York City?**  
by Mariana Mogilevich

In our densely packed city, large swaths of vacant land are a glaring oddity. But they exist, empty acres at Broadway Triangle in Brooklyn, the Seward Park Urban Renewal Area (SPURA) in the Lower East Side, and parts of Edgemere and Willets Point in Queens. These are sites that the city acquired and cleared of all buildings in order to redevelop them. Their futures are still up for debate. To understand what happened and what might be possible down the road, we need to understand the history of urban renewal in New York City. Though this process began more than sixty years ago, urban renewal remains a controversial and active force in neighborhood change in New York.

In 1949 the U.S. government passed a law (Title I of the Housing Act) that allowed and funded cities to undertake projects for urban redevelopment. In New York and elsewhere, planners, businessmen and local governments were concerned that the city center was declining, and that businesses and people, particularly white, middle-class ones, were leaving the city for the suburbs. To combat this, the city started work on plans to redevelop areas that it labeled as “slums” or “blighted.” With its urban renewal powers, the city’s Committee on Slum Clearance (later renamed the Housing and Redevelopment Board) could buy entire blocks of decrepit and overcrowded housing or industrial areas, force residents and businesses to relocate, knock down all the buildings, and sell the new, much larger properties to groups which could build new and modern housing, commercial buildings or cultural and educational facilities on the site.

Some of these urban renewal sites are well-known today, like Lincoln Center. The cultural complex (plus university buildings and luxury housing) stand on what was once almost twenty blocks of tenements. Other projects are more obscure. For example, I live in an unusual corner of New York City that hardly feels like the city at all. My apartment complex stretches across four city blocks, disrupting the street grid. Outside my window, in a seventeen-story white brick building that faces another long and tall slab just like it, is a bird and tree-filled garden, as well as a playground and an underground parking garage. Almost all of my neighbors work for the same employer, New York University, which built Washington Square Village in the 1950s to provide affordable and modern housing for its faculty and to claim a campus for itself in the center of Manhattan. In order to do this, NYU bought a large swath of property—tenements and industrial lofts—deemed obsolete and assembled by the city for private redevelopment.

Both of these projects demonstrate the same logic of urban renewal—clearing large amounts of land to create a “superblock,” replacing mixed and older housing or industrial spaces with modern, improved housing or institutions, and, in the larger scheme of things, make New York a “world class” city with a bright future.

The city could pursue urban renewal because it provided a “public benefit,” but what kind of a public benefited was up for debate. Urban renewal projects displaced thousands of people from their homes, businesses and neighborhoods without their consent. Disproportionately displacing people from communities of color, urban renewal also came to be known as “negro removal.” A related problem was the arbitrary nature of the city’s definitions of obsolescence and blight. Planners needed to show that an area was “blighted” in order to redevelop it. But what experts thought were “slums,” based on appearance or their preconceptions, were not slums to those who lived and worked there. Often, these areas were just not modern-looking, white, or profitable enough. Finally, not everyone was convinced that the new modern projects made a better city than the older, traditional blocks they replaced.

Already in 1954, the federal law was modified to account for criticism of the “superblock” approach to planning. The law now allowed for preserving and rehabilitating housing and neighborhoods as well as demolishing and rebuilding from scratch. Some urban renewal plans would take a more subtle approach, inserting new projects on scattered sites in an existing streetscape.

As New Yorkers contested the city’s urban renewal plans, the program underwent greater change in the 1960s and 1970s. The residents of what was designated the Cooper Square urban renewal area in the Lower East Side didn’t like the city’s plans to demolish their neighborhood and replace it with middle-income housing, so they made their own plan to preserve housing for low-income people on the site. The city finally approved this first community plan in 1970 and it remains in effect today. In 1966, a new federal program called Model Cities demanded citizen participation in urban renewal plans by those who would be affected by them. The Model Cities program enlisted residents to tackle social and economic issues, as well as physical ones, in troubled neighborhoods in Harlem, central Brooklyn, and the South Bronx. Model Cities called for comprehensive neighborhood renewal, with job training, health and educational programs as well as new and rehabilitated housing. Underfunded and the site of political battles, the Model Cities plans did not live up to their promise.

Federal support for urban renewal ended in 1974, but that was not the end of urban renewal in New York City. Under New York State’s urban renewal law, the city still has the power to undertake urban renewal programs in areas “which are slum or blighted, or which are becoming slum or blighted areas because of substandard, insanitary, deteriorated or deteriorating conditions, factors, and characteristics, with or without tangible physical blight.” It can do this in order to “protect and promote the safety, health, morals and welfare” of people, and also to “promote growth and development.” The city has used its urban renewal powers to designate plans and clear areas to make room for housing, industry, and commercial developments like shopping malls and office buildings. Though some plans since the 1970s have targeted smaller areas, even just a couple of lots, others are not so different from the expansive visions of the 1950s.

Some recent and current urban renewal projects, such as those at Willets Point or Atlantic Yards, have raised questions about who benefits from the city’s plans. To make way for the Metrotech office park in Downtown Brooklyn, the city cleared historic rowhouses that may have been stops on the Underground Railroad. And other sites, designated and cleared a long time ago, remain vacant and awaiting redevelopment. The city’s urban renewal plans are not ancient history. The story of urban renewal is still being written, with the fate and future of many sites in the balance.

**Who Makes A Neighborhood?** 
by DW Gibson

The question "Who makes a neighborhood?" provokes very different answers from those who develop land and those who live on that land.

The people who spend time in a shared physical space run the businesses and make the beds; they fill the streets and schools and parks. Jerry the Peddler has been squatting on the Lower East Side for three decades, not a cent of rent paid, just years of hard labor repairing walls and bathrooms and flooring, making a neighborhood by restoring structures that nobody else was willing to care for. Describing the building where he currently lives as part of a group known as C-Squat, the 65-year-old said, "There was no roof, there was no stairs; we had a series of cargo nets that they used to climb up to get from floor to floor. The kids in this building taught themselves carpentry and plumbing and electric." The residents of C-Squat demonstrably make their neighborhood by making their home.

But often, economic forces dictate that those who bring the most money to a neighborhood are the ones who, in the end, make the neighborhood by using their resources to decide the aesthetics of a street, buyout unwanted residents, harass residents in court when they are unwilling to be bought out, support like-minded politicians, and decide on commercial tenants. As the urbanist and long time New Yorker Andrew Ross recently told me, "The permanent government of New York is very wealthy people who are unelected. The pressure does come from them. They expect the city to be governed in their interests. Elected administrators, in the course of their experience, have learned all the customs and rituals and are well habituated to the culture of pleasing the permanent government."  Those that bring the most money to a neighborhood bend that neighborhood to their will, aided by a municipal government all too hungry for the private investment dollars.

But placing the emphasis on investment of money -- instead of investment of time -- reduces neighborhood to the idea of property, when, in fact, the word "neighborhood," a noun, lends itself to all three possibilities of person, place and thing. 

Yes, a neighborhood is a series of physical structures -- offices, apartment buildings, playgrounds, markets, houses of worship -- but the word also contains the idea of the people who fill these spaces -- the residents, the workers, the students. Something about the synthesis of these people and these places makes this thing called neighborhood. As mTkalla Keaton, a 45-year-old lifelong resident of Brooklyn told me: "When I talk about a neighborhood, I think 70 percent of a neighborhood is made up of the people who live there and how the people relate to each other."
Theoretically, the people who spend the most time participating in a neighborhood could also be the people who bring most of the money to that neighborhood. Modern capitalism, however, creates an environment in which international investment plays the leading role. The effect is that the people who spend the most time in a neighborhood and the people who spend the most money there are increasingly discrete groups.

Alan Fishman, who serves as the chairman of the Brooklyn Navy Yard development demonstrated this fact when he described raising money for the project with the EB-5 visa program, (a visa for foreign nationals in exchange for a minimum development investment of $500,000): "It was Chinese people, or Vietnamese people, or whatever people -- Korean people, Indians, I don’t. No fuss, no muss and no memos. We raised 50 million dollars."

While lots of people bring money to a neighborhood -- including visitors passing through for a week or an hour -- it is land developers, by and large, who bring the most money. Land developers can be people -- those that own their home, the wealthiest among us who own several homes or maybe even numerous properties across the city or the country or the world; and land developers can be institutions -- government agencies, banks, hedge funds.

These individuals and institutions operate in a global economic system that cultivates absentee landownership, obscuring them from the people who populate their buildings. And when the people who own and develop the land in a neighborhood do not spend their money and time -- with commensurate generosity -- interacting with that neighborhood, there is no synthesis between person and place. It reduces our understanding of "neighborhood" to land and buildings, devaluing the people who fill those spaces and, worse still, in some cases implying that people, like property, can be controlled, if not owned. A 26-year-old Brooklyn developer named Shlomo, who hesitated to give his last name, did not hesitate to tell me, "Every tenant has a price."

In 21st century capitalism, people, like places, can be purchased, and neighborhoods can be made in whatever way optimizes the capital that can be extracted and wired to Dubai or London or Los Angeles. No other considerations -- adequate amenities, sufficient housing for the entire population, recreation -- matter in this context.

An environment where money invested always wins out over time invested is an environment that undermines the idea of neighborhood by removing people from the definition of the word and, ultimately, the possibilities of how a neighborhood can be made to suit the needs of the people who make their lives there. The separation between ownership of physical spaces and the people who populate them severs the process that makes a neighborhood socially, economically, and environmentally healthy.

If those who own "neighborhood" as place are not "neighborhood" as people then those places and those people cease to function as -- cease to make this thing called -- a neighborhood.
