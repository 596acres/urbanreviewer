## References
We made this map by investigating the urban renewal and neighborhood redevelopment master plans that NYC Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) has in their archives and by relying on a few secondary sources produced by NYC Government offices. 

Although we would love to share the actual plans here, we can’t because we could not afford to purchase copies at 25 cents per page from HPD; this is the statutory rate under the [New York State Freedom of Information Law](http://www.dos.ny.gov/coog/foil2.html) (FOIL). FOIL also requires government agencies to make their documents [available for inspection](http://www.urbanreviewer.org/media/596URPFOILletter_take2.pdf); we took advantage of that portion of the law to arrange for a team of dedicated volunteers to visit the HPD Records Access office regularly for about a year to extract the information you see on the NYC Urban Reviewer from the documents. Our volunteers were not allowed to photograph or make copies of the plans. 

Here are two books that we found particularly helpful: 
NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development. _Community Development Progress Report: 1968._  Prepared and edited by Nathan Sobel. New York City, 1968.   

NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development. _Atlas of Urban Renewal Project Areas in the City of New York._  Prepared and edited by Nathan Sobel.  New York City, 1984.  

A full bibliography is available upon request. 

_There is a bill in the NYC Council called the [OpenFOIL bill](http://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=1796964&GUID=125D4F8F-E4DE-47CA-882D-2C607A5EA819&Options=ID%7CText%7C) that would make a big difference in our ability to see and share government documents: it requires city agencies to post all requested documents to a public web portal after even a single request. If this law was in effect today, HPD would be obliged to post all the plans below. As it is, you have to rely on the careful notes taken by [our volunteers](http://www.urbanreviewer.org/#page=about.html)._

## Missing Plans
HPD provided us with a list of all the plans that ever existed but was not able to actually give us access to all the plans on their list. Although the NYC Urban Reviewer map contains each of those plans, for the ones that HPD has not yet produced, details are missing about planned uses for the included lots. We are continuing to look for the following plans that were missing from HPD's responses to our numerous requests to date:

**Brooklyn**  
- 49th Street-1st Avenue (adopted approx. 1972)*  
- Bergen Street (adopted approx. 1972)*  
- Lindsay Park (adopted in 1962)  
- Lindsay-Bushwick (adopted approx. 1969)  
- Rutland Road (adopted approx. 1971)*  
- Wallabout (adopted 1989)  

**Manhattan**  
- Bella Vista (adopted approx. 1973)  
- Corlears Hook (adopted 1952)
- East 3rd Street-Avenue C (adopted approx. 1969)*  
- Hester-Allen Street (adopted approx. 1969)*  
- Morningside-Manhattanville (adopted approx. 1956)  
- Penn Station South (adopted 1955)  
- Seward Park (adopted approx. 1952) (This one really surprises us! It’s a really high profile stalled redevelopment that has gotten some [recent coverage in the New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/23/nyregion/they-kept-a-lower-east-side-lot-vacant-for-decades.html?_r=0).)  
- United Nations (adopted 1970)  
- Washington Square Southeast
- West Park (adopted 1952)  

**Queens**  
- College Point  

This list will be updated and detailed planned use information will be added as it becomes available. If you have the most recent revision of any of the plans above and would like to share it, please [contact us](#page=contact.html). 

* HPD's records reflect that these plans have been lost. We are searching for them in other City archives. 

## Further Investigation
_What is urban renewal and master planning for our neighborhoods?  Who makes comprehensive neighborhood plans and why?  How have decisions been made about master planning in our cities?  What kinds of narratives were used to promote urban renewal plans?_

The following books, articles, photos, and films explore questions related to urban renewal and master planning in New York and other cities.  We found them helpful to understanding the past and future of planning in our city. This is not a definitive guide but a recommended entry point. We’d love to get your feedback on this list and any insights you have from reading, watching and looking.

City Limits Magazine (January 2011)  
In January 2011, City Limits magazine published an issue about city planning in New York.  There are a series of articles in this issue that explore in depth how planning happens in New York City.  City Limits looks at the past, present and possible future of planning in New York, with reporting from the South Bronx to the Brooklyn waterfront to suburban Staten Island and lessons from Miami to Portland.  The ultimate question explored is “whose dreams will decide” the future of the city?  

**“Boston’s West End: Urban Obsolescence in Mid-Twentieth Century America,”**  
Daniel Abrahamson chapter in _Governing by Design: Architecture, Politics and Economy in the 20th Century_ (2012)  
Daniel Abrahamson explains how planners and policy makers understanding of neighborhoods changed in the 20th century using the case study of Boston’s West End--a neighborhood that Boston’s City Planning Board declared to be “obsolete” in 1951.  Abrahamson investigates the contested politics surrounding the classification of obsolescence and the shift in how neighborhoods slated for annihilation were described from metaphors of irrelevant technology to metaphors of disease. 

“[The Failure of Urban Renewal](http://herbertgans.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/9-%C2%AB-The-Failure-of-Urban-Renewal-Commentary-Magazine.pdf)”  
Herbert Gans in _Commentary Magazine_ (1956).    
Herbert Gans became known for his careful study of Boston’s West end immigrant communities ([The Urban Villagers: Group and Class in the Life of Italian Americans](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1963/feb/01/west-end-story/), published first in 1963), just before they were relocated as part of an urban renewal plan in the 1950s.  In this article, Gans questions the conventional wisdom of categorizing and labeling poor city neighborhoods.  He explains how urban renewal programs so often failed to meet their goals of improving the lives of poor city residents, as he pushed for a serious evaluation and reconsideration of slum clearance and urban renewal policies.  

“[The Return of Urban Renewal](http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/images/content/5/4/540416/fac-pub-fainstein-Return-of-Urban-Renewal-final.pdf),”   
Susan Fainstein in _Harvard Design Magazine_ (2005).  
Susan Fainstein argues that the post WWII urban renewal paradigm has been revived in recent years, especially in the name of “economic development” for New York City neighborhoods.  She explores why policy makers are once again interested in larger scale urban master planning in New York City and how these efforts are conceived by policy makers, and begins to question the implications of such a turn.   

“[Root Shock: The Consequences of African American Dispossession](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3456198/)”  
Mindy Fullilove in _The Journal of Urban Health_ (2001)  
Dr. Mindy Fullilove defines root shock as the traumatic stress reaction to the loss of some or all of one's emotional ecosystem.  Fullilove explains how urban renewal programs have disproportionately burdened African American communities with root shock trauma.

Nate Schwebber article in _New York Times_ (2011)  
This article is about a reunion of residents who were displaced by a NYC slum clearance plan on the Upper West Side. One resident still remembers her neighborhood: “I was very angry about it because there was nothing wrong with our neighborhood... It wasn’t a slum; why tear it down?” 

"[How the Coastline Became a Place to Put the Poor](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/04/nyregion/how-new-york-citys-coastline-became-home-to-the-poor.html?_r=0),"  
Jonathan Mahler article in _New York Times_ (2012)  
Jonathan Mahler explains the development and persistence of large scale master-planned public housing projects in New York, specifically their concentration along the waterfront or at the urban fringe.  In particular, Mahler explores NYC sites such as the Rockaways, Coney Island, and Red Hook. 

**BOOKS**  
**Tom Angotti (2008), New York For Sale: Community Planning Confronts Global Real Estate**  
Angotti, both observer of and longtime participant in New York community planning, focuses on the close relationships among community planning, political strategy, and control over land. After describing the political economy of New York City real estate, its close ties to global financial capital, and the roots of community planning in social movements and community organizing, Angotti turns to specific case studies to explain community planning in the context of global real estate.

**Thomas Bender (2002), The Unfinished City: New York and the Metropolitan Idea**  
Historian Thomas Bender traces a history from the humble beginnings of early New York City to its present towering influence.  And in this he shows how the city is ultimately a place of possibility, full of unfinished work to be done.   This is the metropolitain idea that draws us to engage with the city.  

**Italo Calvino (1972), Invisible Cities**  
Sometimes fiction is better at explaining the reality and complexity of urban life than than fact: a imaginative inspiration for the creativity of the work that we have to do together. With a magical imagery Calvino weaves together fragments of a city past with the patient reminder that the small seemingly insignificant actions and dreams come together to create what we call the city: “without the stones there is no arch.”

**Anthony Flint (2009), Wrestling with Moses: How Jane Jacobs took on New York's master builder and transformed the American city**  
Did you know that the now famous Washington Square Park in NYC almost had a highway driven through it? This is the story of how a small group of New Yorkers saved Greenwich Village from large scale urban renewal master plans. Anthony Flint depicts the relationship between two key urban figures of the 20th century, Jane Jacobs and Robert Moses, as a dramatic struggle for the for the soul of a city.     

**Mindy Fullilove (2005), Root Shock: How Tearing up Neighborhoods Hurts America and What we Can Do About it**  
Large scale urban renewal plans that remake entire neighborhoods do not only change the physical form of cities.  They also leave a lasting scar on the people who are (often forcibly) relocated as their homes are bulldozed.  Mindy Fullilove explains why the traumatic stress reaction related to the destruction of a person’s emotional ecosystem is called “root shock.”    She specifically analyzes the racial implications of root shock, along with the massive urban disinvestment in poor African American communities that accompanied root shock.   

**Jane Jacobs (1961), Death and Life of Great American Cities**  
In her now widely-read account of 20th century urban planning, Jacobs explains how labels like “slum” and “blight” were used to classify urban neighborhoods in advance of massive demolition (and so-called renewal) of mostly immigrant and minority communities.  The book became famous mostly for her insightful observations of everyday urban life told in a compelling narrative style.  Jacobs explains how the diversity and organized complexity of thriving neighborhoods can easily overlooked from the removed distance of a large-scale master plan.   She inspires us to go out in the city and participate in urban life! 

**Hillel Levine and Lawrence Harmon (1993), The Death of an American Jewish Community: a tragedy of good intentions**  
In this case study of a Boston neighborhood, Levine and Harmon show how forces external to the Black and Jewish communities of Boston undermined their relationship.  From outside observers who romanticized the possibility of racial harmony in the 1960s to profit hungry banks eager to perpetuate harassment, panic selling, and violence, the book explores how a neighborhood’s demographics can change so swiftly and dramatically.  The reader is left with the important lesson that even the best intentions of an outsider/observer can create chaos and crisis.  

**Danny Lyon (1967), The Destruction of Lower Manhattan**  
(see book review [here](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/19/arts/design/19bank.html?pagewanted=all))  
Danny Lyon chronicles the demolition of 60 acres of buildings south of Canal Street, some that were part of Lower Manhattan urban renewal projects.  This rare collection of photographs shows an important portrait of the the city we know now came to be.  

**Sarah Schulman (2012), The Gentrification of the Mind: Witness to a Lost Imagination**   
This book explores how neighborhoods known for their creativity, diversity affordability have been replaced by increasingly expensive homogenized privatized experiences.  Sarah Schulman explores how gentrification and neighborhood change is not just about physical change or new people moving into a neighborhood.  She uses rebellious queer culture of the 1980s to reveal how gentrification is about the undermining of of cultural creativity and diversity.

**Walter Thabit (2003), How East New York Became a Ghetto**  
From his own experience working with the community of East New York in the 1960s, Walter Thabit explains the forces behind the dramatic decline of a once flourishing neighborhood.  Thabit’s observations about the lingering impacts of racially biased policies provides a powerful explanation of what a ghetto is and how ghettos are created or sustained.  

**Deborah Wallace and Roderick Wallace (2001), A Plague Upon Your Houses: How New York Was Burned Down and National Health Crumbled**  
A mathematician and an ecologist write together to analyze a forgotten public policy history of New York:  the fire and municipal service cuts in the South Bronx, Harlem, Brownsville, and East New York.  As people’s homes burned down with no fire trucks to put out the fires, policy makers claimed that this was all part of a “planned shrinkage” necessary for the city.  Careful analysis reveals the scientific flaws and devastating public health consequences of planned shrinkage. 

**Samuel Zipp (2010), Manhattan Projects: The Rise and Fall of Urban Renewal in Cold War New York**  
In this historical account of urban renewal in NYC, Samuel Zipp reveals forgotten stories about the people, politics and history of several iconic urban renewal plans including the United Nations building, Stuyvesant Town, Lincoln Center, and the great swaths of public housing in East Harlem.  The result is a compelling history about who shapes cities, how they shape cities, and how the impacts of past interventions builds the city we know today.   

**Alex S. Vitale (2008), City of Disorder: How the Quality of Life Campaign Transformed New York Politics**  
Alex Vitale explains the politics of categorizing and labeling groups of people as dirty, dangerous, or disorderly, specifically through his study of the “Quality of Life” campaign of NYC in the 1990s.
