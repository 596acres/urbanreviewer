The Milbank Frawley Circleâ€“West plan was adopted in 1997 and will expire in 2037. It is a spin-off of the Milbank Frawley Circle urban renewal area and primarily calls for residential and commercial uses, with limited open space.

You can read some of the 1965 NYC Department of City Planning Study that led to the eventual adoption of the plan [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B0R59QsmZxIydlFkVGVmQU9yVmc). This scan was made in 2016 at the National Archives in Washington DC by Charles Chawalko. 

The 1967 City Planning Commission report on the occasion of the plan's approval is [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9k_zNeDs7q-SHVWNl8zR1R2ZHc). The Third Amended Plan (1970) is [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9k_zNeDs7q-dWIxNFhrWG9oZE0) (both retrieved from the Department of City Planning Archives via the Freedom of Information Law).
