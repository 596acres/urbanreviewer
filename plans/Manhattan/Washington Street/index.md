The Washington Street plan was adopted in 1962, last revised in 1992, and expired in 2002. Proposed uses for the plan area include 2 million square feet of commercial/retail space, 1.5 million square feet of residential space, 1 million square feet for institutional uses, and public access to 24-hour shopping plazas or other open space.
