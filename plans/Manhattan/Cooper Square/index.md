In 1959 the New York City Slum Clearance Commission put forward a plan for this area based on the wholesale replacement of existing structures with a "modern" neighborhood. The plan would have displaced the residents of the neighborhood, who spent the next 11 years organizing to replace it. 

To do so, they formed the Cooper Square Committee. The committee organized neighbors to draft a new plan, focused on three goals: 
- Displacement must be minimized
- Development must be carried out in stages
- Site tenants must have first priority for the housing that is developed 

The Cooper Square Committee's Plan was adopted by the NYC Board of Estimates (which pre-dated the City Council) in place of the original Slum Clearance Plan in 1970. It is now expired and the City has transferred the deeds to 21-buildings originally scheduled for demolition to the Cooper Square Community Land Trust. The buildings are managed by the Cooper Square Mutual Housing Association. Many original residents continue to live in the neighborhood. The Cooper Square plan was adopted in 1970, last revised in 2001, and expired in 2010. The plan calls for residential and commercial uses and preserves the Liz Christy garden. It includes these objectives: provide new housing, rehabilitate housing, remove blight, and provide appropriate community facilities, parks, recreational, shopping, parking, and open space.

More about how the community resisted the original plan put forward by the City administration in 1959, and created this plan to save the existing housing stock, start a community land trust and provided hundreds of units of low income cooperative housing: [http://coopersquare.org/about-us/our-historical-accomplishments](http://coopersquare.org/about-us/our-historical-accomplishments)
