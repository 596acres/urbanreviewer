The Lincoln Square plan was adopted in 1957, last revised in 1988, and expired in 1997. It provides for the development of Lincoln Center (a performing arts center) and includes a range of other uses: residential, retail, commercial, public park, school, playground, and institutional (both collegiate and Red Cross).

You can see the **Preliminary Report of the Lincoln Square Project**, published by the Committee on Slum Clearance in 1956 and [digitized from the Columbia University libraries here](https://archive.org/details/preliminaryrepor00newy_0). 

Here's a flavor of what was here before this plan was adopted and realized:
