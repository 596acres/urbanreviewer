The Lincoln Square plan was adopted in 1957, last revised in 1988, and expired in 1997. It provides for the development of Lincoln Center (a performing arts center) and includes a range of other uses: residential, retail, commercial, public park, school, playground, and institutional (both collegiate and Red Cross).

Here's a flavor of what was here before this plan was adopted and realized:
