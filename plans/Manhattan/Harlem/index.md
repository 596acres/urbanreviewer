The Harlem plan was adopted in 1952 and expired in 1992. It calls for middle-income housing, commercial retail, parking, playground, and open space on the lots in the plan area. We mapped this plan based on the following document: Committee on Slum Clearance Plans (1951), _Harlem: Slum Clearance Plan Under Title 1 of the Housing Act of 1949_, adopted 1952. HPD has not yet made the plan available to our team.
