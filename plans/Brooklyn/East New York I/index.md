The East New York I plan is a spin-off of the Central Brooklyn urban renewal area and was adopted in 1986, last revised in 1994, and expires in 2026. The designated uses for lots in the plan area include residential (housing and accessory off-street parking, community rooms, and play areas), commercial, community facility (such as health centers and day care centers), public and institutional (such as schools, libraries, community centers, and hospitals), and public open space.
