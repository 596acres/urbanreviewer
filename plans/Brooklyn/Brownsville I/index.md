The Brownsville I plan was adopted in 1967, last revised in 1995, and expired in 2007. It promotes residential uses with appurtenant recreational, community, and parking facilities; commercial uses limited to local retail and service establishments; manufacturing and expansion of existing industrial uses; and some street closings and openings.
