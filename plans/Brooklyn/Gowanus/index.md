The Gowanus plan was adopted in 1971, last revised in 1976, and expired in 2011. It designates lots in the plan area for industrial use, including all high-performance manufacturing and accessory uses. Its "[p]urpose is to revitalise industrial character and eliminate impediments to land disposition and development, and create job opportuniities in high job deficit area."
