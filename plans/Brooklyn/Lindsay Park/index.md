The Lindsay Park plan was adopted in 1962 and expired in 2002. It concentrates on the development of moderate-income housing and community facilities as well as a playground, public school, and local retail commercial facilities in the plan area. HPD has not yet made the plan available to our team.

We mapped this plan based on secondary sources created by NYC Government offices. See [References](http://www.urbanreviewer.org/#page=references.html).
