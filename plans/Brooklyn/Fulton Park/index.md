The Fulton Park plan, a spin-off of the Central Brooklyn urban renewal area, was adopted in 1988, last revised in 2003, and will expire in 2028, with the exception of portions of three sites that expired in 2008. It demarcates residential, public and quasi-public, public open space, and commercial uses for lots in the plan area.
