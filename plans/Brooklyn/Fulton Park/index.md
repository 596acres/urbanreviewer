The Fulton Park plan, a spin-off of the Central Brooklyn urban renewal area, was adopted in 1988, last revised in 2003, and will expire in 2028, with the exception of portions of three sites that expired in 2008. It demarcates residential, public and quasi-public, public open space, and commercial uses for lots in the plan area.

You can read the 1965 NYC Department of City Planning Study that led to the eventual adoption of the plan [here](https://drive.google.com/a/newschool.edu/file/d/0B0R59QsmZxIyUFpfSmZhSktGMU0/view?usp=sharing). This scan was made in 2016 at the National Archives in Washington DC by Charles Chawalko.
