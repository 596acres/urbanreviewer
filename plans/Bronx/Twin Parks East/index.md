The Twin Parks East plan was adopted in 1967, last revised in 1990, and expired in 2007. It demarcates low- and moderate-income housing, moderate-income housing over a public school, public and/or semi-public space (including schools, parks, and open space), and commercial uses for lots in the plan area.
