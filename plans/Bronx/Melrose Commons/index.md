The Melrose Commons plan was adopted in 1994, last revised in 2006, and expires in 2034. It calls for residential, community facility, public open space, public park, and commercial uses in the plan area.

In the early 90s, residents of the Melrose Commons neighborhood (a 35-block area in the heart of the South Bronx), one of the nationâ€™s poorest congressional districts, fought against a redevelopment plan for the area, **which would have displaced them completely**. As a response to this, a grassroots community group, [Nos Quedamos](http://www.nosquedamos.org/), generated a new redevelopment plan which included area residents instead of displacing them. This plan was the one that City Council voted to adopt in 1994. The plan is still active and many features - like new parks for which land was acquired from residents using eminent domain - have yet to be built. Nos Quedamos continues to be actively involved in the development of Melrose Commons.
