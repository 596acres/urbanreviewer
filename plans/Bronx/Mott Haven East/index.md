The Mott Haven East plan is a spin-off of the South Bronx urban renewal area and was adopted in 1996, last revised in 1999, and expires in 2033. Lots in the plan area are designated for residential, commercial, community facility, recreational, and open space uses. Parts of the plan that were designated through the South Bronx plan expired in 2007 and 2010.
