The Crotona Park East plan was adopted in 1965, last revised in 1975, and expired in 2015. This single-lot plan calls for new housing for low- and moderate-income families with appurtenant community facility, recreational, and park uses; public and semi-public uses such as schools, libraries, and community centers; public open space; and compatible commercial and industrial uses.
