The Flushing Municipal Parking Lot #1 plan was adopted in 1954 and expired in
2004. It calls for the plan area to be used for municipal parking. The lots that
were cleared for renewal mostly consisted of detached working-class houses
surrounding the historic Macedonia African Methodist Episcopal Church in a
racially integrated neighborhood. Today the plan area contains Macedonia Plaza,
an affordable housing development, and interim private parking during the
construction of the future Flushing Commons, a dense mixed-use development that
will include residential, commercial, office, community facility, parking, and
limited open space uses.
