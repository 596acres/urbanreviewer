NYC Housing Preservation and Development, Edgemere Urban Renewal Plan (2008) rev. 1, adopted 1997. See http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/hpd/downloads/pdf/community/first-amended-edgemere-ur-plan.pdf.

Queens Community Board 14 made the following statement in its [FY2016 Statement of District Needs](http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/pdf/neigh_info/statement_needs/qn14_statement.pdf) regarding the plan and its progress: 

"The Edgemere Urban Renewal Area (EURA) [Plan] with its affordable, two family house format was approved by the board and the community. The Board believes that this project will enhance an area that has been in decline for over two decades. 400 two-family homes will be built. A retail area and two new parks are also planned. We are deeply concerned that HPD despite tens of millions of dollars being spent to build new storm and sanitary sewers, [n]ew streets and 
sidewalks in the EURA, that The City has not built one new affordable unit in over six years. The Edgemere project should move forward. The infrastructure is awaiting new affordable homes for deserving New Yorkers."
