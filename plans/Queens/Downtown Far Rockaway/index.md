This urban renewal plan was adopted in 2017. You can see the Economic Development Corporation's view on the area [on their website](https://www.nycedc.com/project/downtown-far-rockaway). This Plan was created specifically to transfer private property that was being underutilized as a strip mall to the City so the City can transfer it to developers who will build housing. The Plan was enacted in combination with a rezoning of the neighborhood. [Citylimits has been covering](https://citylimits.org/2018/07/18/first-signs-of-progress-after-far-rockaway-rezoning/) the rezoning and progress towards redevelopment since it was passed by City Council.
