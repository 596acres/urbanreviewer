This urban renewal plan was adopted in 2017. You can see the Economic Development Corporation's view on the area [here.] (https://www.nycedc.com/project/downtown-far-rockaway) The Plan was created specifically to transfer private property that was being underutilized as a strip mall to the City so the City can transfer it to developers who will build housing. See the plan on HPD's Urban Renewal Plan viewer [here](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/hpd/community/urban-renewal-plans/downtown-far-rockaway.page). This viewer was created based on the inspiration of the urbanreviewer.org. The link to the plan document can be found at the City's website, but the City's map does not show which specific properties are included.
