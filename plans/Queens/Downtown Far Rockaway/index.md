This urban renewal plan was adopted in 2017. You can see the Economic Development Corporation's view on the area [on thier website](https://www.nycedc.com/project/downtown-far-rockaway). This Plan was created specifically to transfer private property that was being underutilized as a strip mall to the City so the City can transfer it to developers who will build housing. The Plan was enacted in combination with a rezoning of the neighborhood. [Citylimits has been covering](https://citylimits.org/2018/07/18/first-signs-of-progress-after-far-rockaway-rezoning/) the rezoning and progress towards redevelopment since it was passed by City Council.

You can see this plan on NYC Housing Preservation and Development's Urban Renewal map [here](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/hpd/community/urban-renewal-plans/downtown-far-rockaway.page). This map and webpages was created based on the inspiration of the urbanreviewer.org. The link to the plan document can be found at the City's website, but the City's map does not show which specific properties are included.
