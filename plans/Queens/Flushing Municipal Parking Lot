The Flushing Municipal Parking Lot #1 plan was adopted in 1954 and expired in 2004. It called for the plan area to be used for municipal parking. 

The lots that were cleared for renewal mostly consisted of detached working-class houses surrounding the historic Macedonia African Methodist Episcopal Church in a racially integrated neighborhood. Today some of the plan area is Macedonia Plaza, an affordable housing development, and the rest is private parking. Flushing Commons, a dense mixed-use development that will include residential, commercial, office, community facility, parking, and limited open space uses is planned for the portion that currently hosts parking.
