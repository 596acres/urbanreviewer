The Willets Point plan was adopted in 2008 and will expire in 2048. Uses for the plan area include at least 8 acres of publicly accessible open space in addition to commercial, residential, institutional, and community facilities. According to the plan, 127 privately owned parcels are proposed for acquisition, one residential unit and approximately 260 businesses will require relocation, and it is anticipated that all private structures within the plan boundaries will be demolished.
